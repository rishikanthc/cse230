## Code for UCSD CSE 230 Programming Languages Course

This repo contains the code I wrote for my assignments for the PL course offered at UCSD.
The repo organization is self explanatory, with a separate folder for each hw and the 
midterm and final folders hold some code I wrote for solving some practice papers.

Homeworks 1-4 cover ocaml, 5 is in prolog and 6,7 are in Python.

The details of the course and assignments can be found [here](https://ucsd-pl.github.io/cse-130-230/fa18/index.html).
